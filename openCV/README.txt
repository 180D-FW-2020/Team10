This python code uses openCV to recognize the green ball on the controller. The center point of the ball is taken and used to calculate the angle the arrow should be
launched. The area of the ball on the screen is also taken. When both buttons are pressed, the area of the ball is recorded. This recorded value is divided by the running
area after the button was held and used to calculate the power of the shot.
